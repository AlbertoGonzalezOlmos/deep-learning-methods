# Deep Learning Methods

Notebooks with exercises using common deep learning libraries. The exercises are part of the IBM AI Engineering professional certificate course in Coursera.

## Notebooks:

<ol>

<li><code>Keras-classification</code></li>

Use of the library Keras to fit a simple neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Libraries:

- keras
- matplotlib

<li><code>Keras-regression</code></li>

Use of the library Keras to fit a simple neural network model for the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients that were used to make them.

Libraries:

- keras
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

<li><code>OpenCV-basicImageProcessing</code></li>

Use of the library OpenCV to perform simple image manipulations:

<ul>
Pixel Transformations:

<li>Histograms </li>
<li>Intensity Transformations</li>
<li>Thresholding and Simple Segmentation </li>

Geometric Operations:

<li>Scaling </li>
<li>Translation </li>
