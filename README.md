# Deep Learning Methods

Notebooks with exercises using common deep learning libraries. The exercises are part of the IBM AI Engineering professional certificate course in Coursera.

## Notebooks:

1. `Keras-classification`

Use of the library Keras to fit a simple neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Libraries:

- keras
- matplotlib

1. `Keras-regression`

Use of the library Keras to fit a simple neural network model for the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients that were used to make them.

Libraries:

- keras
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

1. `OpenCV-basicImageProcessing`

Use of the library OpenCV to perform simple image manipulations:

Libraries:

- OpenCV
