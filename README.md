# Deep Learning Methods

Notebooks with exercises using common deep learning libraries. The exercises are part of the IBM AI Engineering professional certificate course in Coursera.

## Notebooks:

<ol>

<li>`Keras-classification`</li>

Use of the library Keras to fit a simple neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Libraries:

- keras
- matplotlib

<li>`Keras-regression`</li>

Use of the library Keras to fit a simple neural network model for the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients that were used to make them.

Libraries:

- keras
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

<li>`OpenCV-basicImageProcessing`</li>

Use of the library OpenCV to perform simple image manipulations:

Libraries:

- OpenCV
